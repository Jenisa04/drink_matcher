### ðŸ§  Understanding the Correlations

**ðŸ”¹ Pearson Correlation** â€” Measures the _linear relationship_ between two sets of numerical ratings.

> If both usersâ€™ drink **ratings** increase or decrease together at a constant rate, theyâ€™ll have a high Pearson correlation.

**ðŸ”¸ Spearman Correlation** â€” Measures the _rank-based relationship_ between two sets of preferences.

> If both users **rank** drinks in a similar order, even if their exact scores differ, theyâ€™ll have a high Spearman correlation.

ðŸ§ƒ _In short:_

- Pearson cares about **how much** users like each drink.
- Spearman cares about **the order** in which they like them.
